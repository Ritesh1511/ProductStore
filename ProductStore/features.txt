1. CRUD Functionality for Products
Add full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products. This will allow users to manage products in the application.
Use Entity Framework Core for database integration and DTO classes for data transfer.
2. Product Management Features
Product Listing: Display all products with pagination, search, and filters (e.g., by price, category).
Add/Update/Delete Product: Create forms for adding new products and editing/deleting existing ones.
Image Upload: Implement an option to upload a product image using IFormFile.
3. Role-Based Access Control
Implement role-based access, e.g., admin can add, edit, delete products, while regular users can only view products.
Use ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication and authorization.
4. API for Product Management
Expose an API using ASP.NET Core Web API for product management.
Create endpoints for CRUD operations on products, allowing interaction via external clients.
5. Unit Testing
Add unit tests for the controllers and services using a testing framework like xUnit or MSTest.
6. Validation
Implement server-side and client-side validation using Data Annotations (e.g., [Required], [StringLength]).
7. Logging and Exception Handling
Use ILogger to log critical application events and errors.
Implement global exception handling with middleware to catch and log exceptions.
10. Deploy the Application
Host your project on a platform like Azure or Heroku, which shows deployment experience.
These features will significantly enhance your project and demonstrate a solid understanding of web development concepts like database integration, validation, role-based access control, and API design.
